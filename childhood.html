            <h2>A Special Birthday</h2>
            <p>I came into this world on <strong>December 12, 2002</strong> - which coincidentally is Jamhuri Day, Kenya's national holiday celebrating independence. My mother always joked that I was her little independence day gift, arriving right as the nation was celebrating.</p>

            <h2>Growing Up in Kiserian</h2>
            <p>I was born and raised in <strong>Kiserian</strong>, a place that will always feel like home. Our family consisted of my <strong>single mother</strong>, my <strong>older brother</strong>, and my <strong>younger sister</strong>. Being the middle child meant I had to learn to balance looking up to my brother while setting an example for my sister.</p>

            <h2>Facing Challenges Together</h2>
            <p>Our childhood wasn't always easy. With just our mother supporting us, we learned the value of <strong>hard work</strong> and <strong>resourcefulness</strong> early on. But what we lacked materially, we made up for in <strong>love</strong> and <strong>togetherness</strong>.</p>
            <p>Some of my strongest memories are of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sharing one textbook between the three of us for homework</li>
                <li>Our mother working late shifts but still making time to check our schoolwork</li>
                <li>My brother protecting us from neighborhood bullies</li>
                <li>Teaching my sister how to ride a bike with our makeshift version</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Unbreakable Bonds</h2>
            <p>Despite the hardships, our family grew incredibly <strong>close</strong>. We developed our own traditions:</p>

                <div class="tradition-item">
                    <h3>Sunday Stories</h3>
                    <p>Every Sunday evening, we'd gather to share our week's experiences and dreams</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tradition-item">
                    <h3>Birthday Celebrations</h3>
                    <p>Even with little money, my mother made sure each birthday felt special with her famous mandazi</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tradition-item">
                    <h3>Homework Time</h3>
                    <p>The three of us would study together at our small kitchen table every night</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>These experiences taught me that <strong>family isn't about what you have, but who you have</strong>.</p>
